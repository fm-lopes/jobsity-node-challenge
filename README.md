# Node.js Challenge

Technologies used:

### Typescript
- Typescript is used on both services to ensure type-safety

### Docker & Docker Compose
- Both services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated using docker-compose. There are 3 services needed to run the application:
    - redis: Used by stock-service for caching purposes since it calls an external API;
    - stock-service: microservice for querying Stooq API;
    - api: API for querying stock-service, handle authentication (JWT) and database integration;

### Documentation
- Swagger is used on API service for documentation and playground. To use it, start the service and go to the url: /api-docs/swagger.

### Authentication
- JWT Authentication is available on the api service and the token is generated by calling the endpoint /login with email and password.

### Testing
- To run tests for both services, simply run `npm test` on each one, after starting the related services.

### Start the services
- Each service can be started manually or with all at once with `docker-compose up`:

## stock-service
- Start redis with `docker-compose up cache`;
- Run `npm install`;
- Run `npm start`;

## api-service
- Run `npm install`;
- Run `npm start`;
